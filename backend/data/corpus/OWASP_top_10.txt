OWASP Top 10 - 2023

1. Broken Access Control
Description: Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data.

2. Cryptographic Failures
Description: Previously known as "Sensitive Data Exposure", this category focuses on failures related to cryptography which often lead to exposure of sensitive data.

3. Injection
Description: Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.

4. Insecure Design
Description: Focuses on risks related to design and architectural flaws, including threat modeling and secure design principles.

5. Security Misconfiguration
Description: This is the most common issue. Misconfiguration can happen at any level of an application stack, including network services, platform, web server, app server, database, etc.

6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
Description: Using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable attacks and impacts.

7. Identification and Authentication Failures
Description: Previously known as "Broken Authentication", this category covers failures in authentication and session management.

8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
Description: This category focuses on code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations, such as unsigned software updates or deserialization flaws.

9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
Description: This category focuses on the lack of proper logging and monitoring which can lead to delayed or undetected breaches.

10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Description: SSRF flaws occur when a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL, allowing attackers to force the server to make requests to unintended destinations.
